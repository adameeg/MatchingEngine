This code works like a simplified trading machine on a stock exchange, trading an asset through 3 types of order (Limit, market and pegged). 
It is possible to add, modify and cancel orders following the instructions provided when the machine is initialized.
Limit orders that would generate trades were filled to make the machine more dynamic and to avoid overcrowding the offer book, making it easier to view. This Matching Engine doesn't calculate the average price of the asset.
